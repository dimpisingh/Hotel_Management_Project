<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Hotel Management tool is a versatile program designed to efficiently manage various activities within a hotel setting. It offers a user-friendly menu-driven interface and remains operational until the user chooses to exit. This tool encompasses several key features to enhance the management of the hotel's operations.

One of its core functionalities is the ability to store customer details securely. This feature facilitates the systematic organization of guest information, ensuring a seamless check-in and stay experience.

Customers can choose from four distinct room types, allowing for tailored accommodation options. The program's booking system ensures that room availability is managed effectively, preventing double bookings and conflicts. If a user attempts to book an already allocated room, the program gracefully handles this situation by throwing a user-defined exception.

Additionally, guests can place food orders directly through the tool, specifying their room number. This simplifies the food service process and enhances the overall guest experience.

To maintain continuity in hotel operations, the program employs file handling techniques. Customer details, booked rooms, and food orders are all saved in a file when the program exits. Upon restarting, the program reads this file to restore the hotel's previous status, ensuring that no data is lost.

Furthermore, the tool provides information about room features, aiding customers in making informed decisions. It also offers real-time room availability checks, enabling users to identify vacant rooms at a glance.

Behind the scenes, the program leverages multithreading for efficient file writing, ensuring that data is saved in parallel with other operations, enhancing performance and responsiveness.

To enhance program robustness, extensive exception handling is in place to gracefully manage unexpected errors or inputs. This includes handling situations such as file read/write issues, ensuring the tool remains reliable and user-friendly.

Overall, this Hotel Management tool encompasses various programming concepts, including Classes and Objects, Inheritance, File Handling with Objects, ArrayList, implementing Interfaces, User-defined Exception handling, and comprehensive Exception handling techniques. Its versatility and attention to detail make it an invaluable asset for hotel management.</p>
